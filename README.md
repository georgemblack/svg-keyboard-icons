# SVG Keyboard Icons
Free SVG icons representing most traditional keys on a standard keyboard. Includes special keys for Mac (command, option, etc) and Windows (alt, windows, etc).

I made these in my free time, and wanted others to be able to use them as well. Feel free to modify and use them for any purpose. If you have any questions, shoot me an email at [contact@georgeblack.me](mailto:contact@georgeblack.me).

There are 65 icons in total.
